                Making a pour-over coffee is a simple yet meticulous process that allows you to fully appreciate the flavor and aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Here's a step-by-step guide to making pour-over coffee:
            </p>
            <h3>Equipment needed:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour-over coffee dripper (e.g., Chemex, Hario V60, or Kalita Wave)</li>
                <li>Coffee filter (specific to your dripper)</li>
                <li>Freshly ground coffee (medium grind, like sand)</li>
                <li>Kettle (preferably a gooseneck kettle for better control)</li>
                <li>Scale (optional but recommended for precision)</li>
                <li>Hot water (filtered water is ideal)</li>
                <li>Timer (optional, but helps with timing)</li>
                <li>Coffee mug or carafe</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Guide:</h3>
            <ol class="ol">
                <li><Strong>Boil Water</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by boiling water. You'll need about 200°F (93°C) for brewing. If you don’t have a thermometer, bring water to a boil, then let it sit for about 30 seconds to cool slightly before brewing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Prepare Your Coffee</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Measure your coffee beans. A common ratio is 1:15 coffee to water. For example, if you’re using 20 grams of coffee, you’ll use 300 grams of water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Grind your coffee beans to a medium coarseness, similar to sea salt. A uniform grind size is important to ensure an even extraction during brewing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li><li><Strong>Set Up the Pour-Over Dripper</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place your pour-over dripper on top of your coffee mug or carafe.
                            Insert a coffee filter into the dripper and rinse it with hot water to remove paper taste and preheat the dripper. This also helps prevent the filter from collapsing during brewing. Discard the rinse water.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><li><Strong>Add Ground Coffee</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour the freshly ground coffee into the filter. Gently shake the dripper to level the grounds, which helps ensure an even extraction</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><li><Strong>Bloom the Coffee</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start the timer and pour a small amount of water (about 2x the weight of the coffee, e.g., 40 grams for 20 grams of coffee) over the coffee grounds. This is called the bloom. It allows the coffee to degas and enhances the flavor.
                            Let it sit for about 30 seconds to allow the coffee to bloom and release CO₂</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Continue Pouring the water</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            After the bloom, pour the remaining hot water in a slow, circular motion, starting from the center and spiraling outward to avoid disturbing the grounds.
Pour in stages (e.g., pour 100 grams of water, wait for it to drain, then pour another 100 grams). Continue this process until you’ve poured the desired amount of water (e.g., 300 grams for a 1:15 ratio).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Let the coffee dripp</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            After you’ve poured all the water, allow the coffee to drip completely through the filter. This should take about 2.5 to 3.5 minutes for a single cup, depending on the grind size and pour rate.
The total brewing time from start to finish should be around 3 to 4 minutes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Serve and enjoy</Strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Once the brewing is complete and the dripper stops dripping, remove the pour-over dripper and discard the filter with the grounds.
Stir the coffee in your mug or carafe to mix the flavors evenly, then serve.
